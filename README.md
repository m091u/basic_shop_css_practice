# "HTML & CSS Project"

**Site is live at https://m091u.github.io/basic_shop_css_practice/


**Challenge:** Utilize the knowledge you have gained from the [HTML for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0Zuz27SZ-6OlAwitnFUubtE93DO-l0vu) tutorial series to build a website for The Little Taco Shop. 

**Directions:**

- There is minimal CSS already available in css/styles.css. You need to link that file to your HTML files. 

- All images are provided in the img folder.

- If you need to find taco emojis, try [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/taco/). 

- A favicon is already included. You'll need to add it in the head section of each page.
